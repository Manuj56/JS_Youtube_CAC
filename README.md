<h1>☕ Learning JavaScript</h1>

<p>Hey there! 👋
Welcome to my JavaScript learning journey powered by Chai aur Code
 — the coolest corner on YouTube for developers who like their code with a pinch of fun 😎

This repo is my personal playground 🛠️ — a place where I’ll keep pushing files, projects, and experiments as I learn JavaScript step by step.
From basic syntax to crazy logic-building, you’ll find it all evolving right here, one commit at a time 💻✨</p>

<h2>🌱 What You’ll See Here</h2>
<ul>
<li>My daily / weekly JavaScript practice files</li>

<li>Notes, logic breakdowns, and console experiments</li>

<li>Small projects and exercises from Chai aur Code tutorials</li>

<li>Occasional “aha!” moments turned into code 😄</li>
</ul>
<h2>🚀 Goal</h2>

<p>To build a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, improve logic-building, and eventually move towards advanced topics like DOM manipulation, APIs, and frameworks.</p>

<h2>💡 Motto</h2>

<p>“Code. Debug. Learn. Repeat.”</p>

<h2>📅 Progress</h2>

<p>I’ll keep updating this repo time by time as I continue learning.
