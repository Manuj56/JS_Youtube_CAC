☕ Learning JavaScript

Hey there! 👋
Welcome to my JavaScript learning journey powered by Chai aur Code
 — the coolest corner on YouTube for developers who like their code with a pinch of fun 😎

This repo is my personal playground 🛠️ — a place where I’ll keep pushing files, projects, and experiments as I learn JavaScript step by step.
From basic syntax to crazy logic-building, you’ll find it all evolving right here, one commit at a time 💻✨

🌱 What You’ll See Here

My daily / weekly JavaScript practice files

Notes, logic breakdowns, and console experiments

Small projects and exercises from Chai aur Code tutorials

Occasional “aha!” moments turned into code 😄

🚀 Goal

To build a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, improve logic-building, and eventually move towards advanced topics like DOM manipulation, APIs, and frameworks.

💡 Motto

“Code. Debug. Learn. Repeat.”

📅 Progress

I’ll keep updating this repo time by time as I continue learning.
